Main contributors
-----------------

Thanks to [Struan Bartlett](https://github.com/struanb) for conceiving the
model of iterative web development through the use of ready-built, stageable
and disposable development environments running web-based IDEs, and for leading
the development of Dockside.

Thanks also to other members of the NewsNow development team for contributing
the Dockside Vue client, design and architectural ideas, support and advice,
code and code-reviews; for coining the term _devtainers_; and for the original
Dockside logo concept.

Thanks also to the entire design and development, editorial and testing teams
at [NewsNow](https://www.newsnow.co.uk/about/) for so enthusiastically adopting
containerised development working practices and for subjecting Dockside to so
many years of robust use (and abuse) during the course of their daily iterative
development, evaluation and testing of the
[NewsNow](https://www.newsnow.co.uk/) platform - and proving the value of this
development model.

Thanks last but not least to [NewsNow](https://www.newsnow.co.uk/about/),
_The Independent News Discovery Platform_, for sponsoring the development of
Dockside.
